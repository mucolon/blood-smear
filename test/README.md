# test

This directory includes test code for the Blood Smearing Device.

## File Descriptions

The `test_gui.py` file tests for a working graphical user interface.

The `test_inductive.py` file reads binary data from inductive sensors.

The `test_interrupts.py` file tests if sensor interrupts are working.

The `test_output.py` file tests if `output` function in `digital_io.py` is working.

The `test_read2.py` file tests if the `read2` function in `digital_io.py` is working.

The `test_servo_angle.py` file tests a servo motor's rotation by angle inputs.

The `test_servo_duty.py` file tests a servo motor's duty cycle range.

The `test_smear.py` file uses all the motors and sensors in the assembly for making a quality smear. This file also uses a terminal interface.

The `test_stepper.py` file tests the stepper motor at different input speeds.
